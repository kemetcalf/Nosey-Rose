  <h1>Rose the Stubborn</h1>
  <p>Rose is a wild terrier mix of untold pig-headedness and destructive capability. She is deceptively heavy, which adds to the effectiveness of her wrecking ball abilities. Hard claws help her dig freshly planted gardens, and sharp teefers allow her to shred evil tissue boxes that threaten her family.</p>
  <ul>Her interests include:</ul>
    <li>Sleeping with her butt on people's pillows</li>
    <li>Harrassing her old, deaf doggy housemate</li>
    <li>Ignoring commands</li>
    <li>Systematically misshaping all furniture cushions with her aforementioned deadweight</li>
    <li>Hunting butterflies, birds, and other small creatures that bring joy to the world</li>
  <p>Dogumented proof of the deception:<a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/52yhSER" target="_blank">a cat in a dog's body.</a></p>
